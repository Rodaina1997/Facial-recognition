# Facial-recognition
Machine Learning project that detects face, for a given image we can tell the subject id. Our dataset was 40 subjects and 10 images per subject. <br />
1) We Converted every image into a vector of values corresponding to the image Size. <br />
2) Stacked the 400 vectors into a single Data Matrix D and generated the label vector y. <br />
3) Then splitted the dataset into training and test sets. <br />
4) Then, classified using PCA. <br />
5) Finally did the classifier tunning using KNN classifier.
